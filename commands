SEE THIS TOMORROW!

-We have to make RouteView handle multiple stop ID's!
-We could use our StopView as a parent and hold data for the children
-StopView loops and passes all it's attributes + stop_id[i] down to a child
    RouteView. In RouteView.parse(), tell it's parent StopView to re-render
    and attach the content appropriately.
